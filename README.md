# Introduction to R Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Introduction to R Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/introduction-data-science-using-r-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789959840), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
	Split in to three parts, main motivations are to quickly introduce programming concepts in R to developers.part 1: will introduce R, it’s motivations, R Studio (the IDE I’d like to use) and the basics of R – using packages, programming concepts such as variables, vectors, arrays, loops, matrices etc etc.part 2: moves in to more advanced topics in R – functional vs object oriented programming etc. Focus starts shifting from the language basics to working with R – how to start working with data.part 3: will end with a small project. Possibly we will visualize some simple data and learn how to publish it.
